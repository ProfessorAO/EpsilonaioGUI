Trent | Israel Adesanya | Tierney | Villarreal | Nacho | Xhaka | #UFC287 | Chukwueze
Isreal would have been barred from competing as a UFC fighter,if he had a history of trafficking narcotics.I know some of you lack good upbringing and role models in your lives hence good morals isn't a value you embody or instill into your children.
Alex Pereira is easily the most accomplished kick-boxer in the UFC & Israel flat lined him. 

Adesanya is the greatest striker in MMA history.
CASHOUT!!! Drake Wins $2.7Million As Israel Adesanya Floored Alex Pereira -
Absolute LEGEND... Israel Adesanya @stylebender has faced the best of the best, and after the performance on Saturday night, he is (in my opinion) the best UFC Middleweight who has ever entered the Octagon!

Israel Adesanya Beats Alex Pereira by Knockout at UFC 287 to Win Middleweight Title (video)
Dis one na Israel Adesanya knock out style
Burns has been KO’d twice in his UFC career. He got dropped with a jab by Usman then TKO’d and KO’d by Hooker. In over 100 combined mma/kickboxing fights Israel has been KO’d twice. Both by Alex Pereira one of the hardest punchers in combat sports. Both have solid chins.
Palestines fight to eliminate Isreal. On the other hand Isreal is fighting for their very existence
With his latest win against Alex Pereira, Israel Adensanya is the top dog  and box office draw of the UFC.
I'm an Israel fan, but Poatan is the boogeyman. I was scared shtless for Adesanya. Alex will be a destructing force at lightheavy.

Congratulations Sir Israel Adesanya!!!  You are doing well Sir !!!    
For f**ks sake. It was great. I hope that kid learned a lesson. He made his dad's rivalry and Israel his business. So he deserves every ounce of mockery that Adesanya served him. This sport is brutal, You cheer for people getting KOed, You're pathetic too!
Adesanya is the one who should move to 205 if another fight is not happening. There are no challengers here, only Pereira. Israel defeated Jared and both Marvin / Rob (twice).

Israel X Jamahal for the 205 belt.
Pereira X Whittaker for the 185 belt.
I’d knock Israel Adesanya out cold

We should respect AP. Most of these guys aren't Alex Perreira fans, they're simply Israel Adesanya haters who have just on the Perreria bandwagon, but in truth, don't give a shit about him. They'll be cheering for Israel's next opponent in 6 months time.

This is likely what the leak was really about, not ukraine. Israel has a powerful right wing that is capable of fighting back against the left
Deeply inspired by Israel Adesanya’s performance last night, man. I need to achieve greatness and rise up to experience that level of happiness he mentioned. Hungry for life! I need greatness like one needs oxygen to breathe. One life! Make it count.
The record also will still read that Israel Adesanya is the UFC Middleweight Champion.
Oh and, just to be clear,  I don't like Izzy and was hoping that Pereira was going to knock him out last night.

So where is all the hate talk for Israel adesanya for looking at Pereira's son and dropping to the ground (imitating a knockout of the dad's child)? But folks get mad at angel Reese for performing the ("you can't see me taunt to clark") speak up, let me hear yal!! @Reese10Angel

Fighting on a level playing ground with rules clearly stated and adhered to requires little or no room for manipulation. 

That you can assume Isreal's course is similar to election in Nigeria, shows you know things in bits and pieces.

Except you're chasing clout sha.
I'm only here because I like Israel, the other Israel sucks, guess that makes me anti-Semitic. Alex had two battles, weight cut and fighting the new 185lbs goat. Anderson Silva is officially number 2
Thank you, Israel Adesanya and Golden State Warriors.

One shine outside Nigeria, the other shine and live inside Nigeria against all odds. Imagine Israel Adesanya was in Nigeria, how many kick boxing competition dey Nigeria? Nigeria would've happened to him.

I'm glad he escaped and I'm proud of him for putting us on the map.

A history lesson.  In 1948 Israel declared statehood.  The following day they were attacked by 5 Arab Armies.  The Arabs lost that war and every war since.  Israelis are sick of fighting.  Every Arab country I have been in looks the same.  Poverty and filth.

Some thoughts after #UFC287… Israel Adesanya has regained the throne and is once again king of the middleweights. What a viscous knockout by Stylebender. I think he should hang out for a little bit while we await the middleweight debut of Khamzat Borz Chimaev…
Just take a look at Isreal Adesanya, cashing out with his fighting skills. Some young folks, when they realise they are physically strong, the only thing that comes to their mind is to join cult to bully their fellows. While their mates are earning big from their fighting prowess
Congratulations Israel Adesanya for your well deserved victory! Nigeria is lucky to have you!

Israel Adesanya has admitted it was “petty” to go after Alex Pereira’s young son after he brutally knocked out his dad at UFC 287.
Let me give you the very shortened version of this, in 2017 a man named Alex Pereria KO’d another called Israel Adesanya, last night Israel got him back albeit in a much more vicious and violent fashion. The reason he flopped “dead” is in this vid below:

dominating is a strong word. And so was israel in the first fight. Champs with titel defences get a rematc. Alex hasnt earned it after he was beat decisively like that
Why must you attempt to attach this ethnic card to everything.
