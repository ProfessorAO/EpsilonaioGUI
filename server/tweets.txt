The first two episodes were so promising. The subsequent episodes focused more on world building which I didn’t mind. However, after watching Andor, the world building just felt significantly less engaging compared to Andor. After episode five, I lost the hype for new episodes.

Hype train number 2 of 2023!
Blockbuster chick, clarity and Trick_TTR are insane!!!
Indeed. Errea, to be fair, will have given the club a better deal than Nike etc. Lower league clubs with Nike etc will get an off the rail generic kit from their catalogue & a crap deal re profit split.
Nike said just do it

It sort of scares me how many people I saw go full time in the bull run, though it surely is none of my business it is concerning. This game isn’t easy, and when the hype finally dies down, do you have a plan? Do you have clients?!
Happy Birthday 
Swanky will hype you up.
But also y'all decided to do one of the most impressive mental gymnastics I have seen ever to claim that the effects of defective smile fruit is not a disease which is worse, and I am not impatient I never claimed that he should've cured them right then and there
Game quality.

P2E got too much focus and hype, and as a consequence the focus was playing a game only to earn.

That set back game quality, thankfully the tide is turning albeit slowly.
i dont have anyone to send eid pics this time no one talk to me :/ who will hype me up
BOOM! BIG BOOM!
I'll be honest, I'm gonna fade Dandies, and you should too  
There is absolutely no reason to check announcements dropping today, probably just some fake hype bs  
Probably nothing worth bothering with  I'm gonna sell the news tbh  Probably

Comferences are always about networking. You usually get nothing out of most workshops, just hype and the occasional live ad for something new.
i still dont understand the gyuvin hype sorry
THAT SNEAKERS TWEET IS SO ICONIC HELP
How is it this tough? Jordan is a part of Nike, but you’d swear they are one two opposite sides of the world. They can’t borrow some designers from Nike?
All from L0VERZProject ( @_QueC ) except purple & orange swim trunks are Nike

Obvious probs w/ GOP running sovereigns *like a business* tropes.

Sovereigns don’t have earnings or shareholders.

Another is successful businesses never hype terminal cost cuts growth rates b/c each are living revenue growth organisms.

Imputes tax revenue growth matters too.
I need a Hype Man... everytime I do something that's awesome... I need my own hype man.
2 years ago on 4/20 I was in Denver & that shit was def worth the hype back then lol miss it

Thread 4: #NFTs can also have a positive impact on sustainability efforts. In the future world, they can be used to track the ownership and lifecycle of physical goods, such as luxury handbags and sneakers, reducing waste and increasing transparency in supply chains.

Definitely not worth all the hype.
More engines, more points of failure. Redundant and inefficient in most cases. Love this for SpaceX. Useless hype machine.
Don’t believe the hype
Not in any way that intimates a rip-off, I mean this in total and complete praise and hype
What a dull 3rd kit. Sadly, Adidas, and Nike produce boring,  corporate, souless, cookie cutter kits now. Hummel is the only major kit house that actually produces cool, creative jerseys.
